# Bachelor-Computer-Engineering-Notes
All the digital notes that I wrote to survive my bachelor in Computer Engineering at the "Universit√† degli Studi di Roma Tor Vergata" 


I wrote everythimlg on oneNote so I'm going to share the the Link to every noteBook which is dedicated to a specific class and you can import that in your oneNote on your preferred device.

Some notebooks are more detailed with notes from the professors, my notes and exercises with and in most cases some Exams with the correct answears too.
